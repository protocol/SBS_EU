### This document builds off the [SBS EU Travel GHG Calculation Overview document](https://github.com/protocol/SBS_EU/blob/main/Travel_GHGs/Calculation_Overview.md).

The Filecoin Green Team is committed to making the Sustainable Blockchain Summit as carbon neutral as possible. One of the primary ways we are doing this is by offsetting the emissions generated by the travel of our attendees and speakers. To achieve this goal, we have been collecting relevant travel-related information from all Attendees and Speakers.

As we collect this information, we are [calculating the total emissions impact](https://github.com/protocol/SBS_EU/blob/main/Travel_GHGs/Calculation_Overview.md) and plan to procure high-quality carbon offsets to match 2X the travel-related emissions. We are committed to procuring these high-quality carbon offsets in a transparent & democratic manner, and are experimenting with a community governance process to decide which offsets we procure. This Governance process can be summarized by the following steps (see [here](https://github.com/protocol/FilecoinGreen-tools/blob/main/0007-FGTP-Offset_SBS.md) for more info):
 
1. Seek input and source quotes from various offset providers. (If interested, please fill out the [**form here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdovh5tWExsZSxEgtD9ObOiVDL1sHa2AyZQU_VOZAsLYvGAQ/viewform) <-- Available until Sunday, August 28th)
2. Allow SBS attendees, and a select panel of experts, the opportunity to rate the available offsets according to the [ICVCMâ€™s Core Carbon Principles](https://icvcm.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ICVCM-Public-Consultation-FINAL-Part-2.pdf), and publish the collective ratings in this repo.
3. Design an algorithm to allocate capital to offset projects according to the ratings.
4. Procure Offsets accordingly and register them on Filecoin via [CO2.Storage](https://github.com/protocol/FilecoinGreen-tools/blob/main/0006-FGTP-CO2_Storage.md).
5. Airdrop tokens to attendees and speakers that we have wallet addresses for with details of offset activity.

We firmly believe that this process will increase public trust in environmental claims, and will showcase the type of community governance processes that can be built in Web3 to help shift offset procurement decisions towards better outcomes.


If you attended SBS, and have not filled out the [SBS Attendee List Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNSmDINZgCaWWIU5Z0_F0abqm3DLTfzDBrns8be0NCk0Fl1g/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) please do so we can include your information in our calculation.
