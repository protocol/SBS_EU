### This document builds off the Idea listed in Filecoin Green Tools repo: [0007-FGTP-Offset_SBS](https://github.com/protocol/FilecoinGreen-tools/blob/main/0007-FGTP-Offset_SBS.md).

The Filecoin Green Team is committed to making the Sustainable Blockchain Summit as carbon neutral as possible. One of the primary ways we are doing this is by offsetting the emissions generated by the travel of our attendees and speakers. To achieve this goal, we are collecting relevant travel-related information from all Attendees and Speakers.

To perform the GHG calculation, we will use data from the [SBS Attendee List Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNSmDINZgCaWWIU5Z0_F0abqm3DLTfzDBrns8be0NCk0Fl1g/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) to calculate the total emissions impact of the collective travel of all attendees and speakers *to* and *from* SBS. This calculation will be conducted according to the [International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Methodology](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/CarbonOffset/Documents/Methodology%20ICAO%20Carbon%20Calculator_v11-2018.pdf), which employs a distance-based approach to estimate an individualâ€™s
aviation emissions using data currently available on a range of aircraft types, and will be reinforced by the [Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework Methodology](https://www.smartfreightcentre.org/en/glec-framework-implementation/).

We are currently analyzing the attendee information and conducting the calculation. Our current estimated totals are listed below (***based on available data and subject to change***):

<div align="center">
  
| Totals:        | Count:    | 2x Multiple: |
|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Attendees      | 312       |              |
| Countries      | 16        |              |
| Total passengers CO2 (KG) | 263,416.0 KG | 526,832.0 KG  |
| Total passengers (Tonnes CO2e) | 290.4 CO2e | 580.7 CO2e  |

Please refer to the [SBS EU Offsetting Implementation Plan](https://github.com/protocol/SBS_EU/blob/main/Travel_GHGs/Offsetting_Implementation_Plan.md) to read about our plan to procure high-quality carbon offsets to match 2X the travel-related emissions (estimated 580.7 CO2e). 

If you attended SBS, and have not filled out the [SBS Attendee List Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdNSmDINZgCaWWIU5Z0_F0abqm3DLTfzDBrns8be0NCk0Fl1g/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0), please do so we can include your information in our calculation.
